Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are two of the most commonly observed neurodevelopmental conditions in childhood. Providing a specific computational assessment to distinguish between the two can prove difficult and time intensive. Given the high prevalence of co-occurrence of the two conditions, there is a need for machine learning (ML) models that can distinguish this concurrence from individual diagnoses. We trained ML models on the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) data to identify behavioral features that can be used for automated clinical decision support. This study shows the potential of using behavioral diagnostic questionnaires as a supporting tool for clinicians for mobile screening assessment.
